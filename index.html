        <p>Zbalermorna is a diacritic orthography for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lojban">Lojban</a>, created by la kmir. A couple diferent versions of the write-ups exist in the wild, and this page is an attempt to consolodate all of the information on Zbalermorna, and provide resources for fonts, IMEs, and other software.</p>
        <p>The page itself is hosted on Github pages through <a href="https://github.com/jackhumbert/zbalermorna/">Jack's fork</a> of <a href="https://github.com/lakmeer/zbalermorna">la kmir's official repo</a> - most of the content here should be considered a <b>unofficial</b>, and while some feedback on the ideas proposed has been collected from la kmir, a lot of it is still actively being worked on.</p>
